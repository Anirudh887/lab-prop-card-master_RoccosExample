# LAB 2 :- Take a look at 3 news website and evaluate two pages (article, index/list)

- https://www.nytimes.com : Major Break point is at 740px, lower than which it shifts to a more vertical layout.
  Ads are same in both layouts since they span an entire row
  A row where it show more articles actually gets cut off in smaller views and there is no horizontal scrolling for that part.
  They print a Now Hiring thing on their console.
  In article page the content is usually centred which is nice for a wide screen.
  Heading changes from on top of the article image to below it when we reduce screen size.


- www.cbc.ca : Similar to previous site. More news cards at the bottom change from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 in  a row based on screen size.
  That aspect is better than the above site.
  On the article they have annoying sticky ads which scroll with you. The second one even hid comments on a smaller screen.
  Disappering ad on the top in smaller screens


- www.theverge.com/ - Shifts everything into its own rows at <699px
Using Heroic font for headings which is a narrower font. Already the design is such that not much stuff needs to be arranged.
Each article is a new row.
In the article page, they have autoplaying videos which is annoying which reminded me to turn off the setting in the browser.
Ads get shifted to bottom from the side so article column space increases.
